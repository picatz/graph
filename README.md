# graph

A [graph](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Graph.html) is a collection of "nodes" (a.k.a points or vertices) and "edges" (a.k.a lines or arcs) connecting some (possibly empty) subset of them. The edges of graphs may also be imbued with directedness. The study of graphs is known as [graph theory](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/GraphTheory.html).
